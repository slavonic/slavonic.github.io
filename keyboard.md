## Church Slavonic Keyboard Drivers

Keyboard drivers are the next thing you need after a font in order to work with Church Slavonic text. 
Entering text using the Character Map (or some similar utility) is not just slow, it can also cause problems like 
improper positioning of diacritical marks. Several different options are available for entering Church Slavonic text on 
the keyboard. 

### Virtual keyboards

A virtual keyboard allows you to type Church Slavonic text without installing any software.
Just enter the text into your browser and then copy/paste it into a text editor or generate
a PDF for printing.

### Installable keyboard drivers

Keyboard drivers can be installed on your computer.
The **Russian Extended** keyboard allows you to enter Russian text on the standard Russian
ЙЦУКЕН keyboard and provides Church Slavonic characters on Level 3 (AltGr).
The **Russian Phonetic** keyboard offers the same functionality, but using the phonetic
Russian (ЯВЕРТЫ) layout. The **Church Slavonic** keyboard is a completely new layout
optimized for entering Church Slavonic text. A Church Slavonic **Glagolitic** keyboard
is also available for entering Glagolitic text (only for GNU / Linux systems).
